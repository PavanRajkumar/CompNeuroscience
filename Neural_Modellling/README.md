# Poisson Neuron Models and Population Coding

Based on a set of artificial experiments that are run on four simulated neurons that emulate the behavior found in the cercal organs of a cricket

Data : recorded firing rates in Hz (tuning_3.4.pickle)


Ran an additional set of experiments in which each of the neurons is exposed to a single stimulus of unknown direction for 10 trials of 10 seconds each
pop_coding contains four vectors named r1, r2, r3, and r4 that contain the responses (firing rate in Hz) of the four neurons. Also contains four vectors named c1, c2, c3, and c4. These are the basis vectors corresponding to neuron 1, neuron 2, neuron 3, and neuron 4. Decoding the neural responses.
